using rake tasks and a console and REPL based workflow is what made rubymotion so awesome



but when I test running over 100 projects, dont want to duplicate certain things done manually, this is a the outcome of it


inspired from rake and sake tasks

      git clone git://github.com/railsfactory/.motion.git ~/.motion
      PATH=~/.motion/bin:$PATH
      export PATH
